    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is <a href=..\img\headshot.PNG>Vishal Vunnam</a> , I was born and raised in Colorado. I am majoring in Creative Technology and Design and minoring in Philosophy and Comp-sci. I enjoy skating, playing jazz piano and guitar, and crocheting beanies and bags for my friends:). </p>
    <h2>Goals for Web 2200</h2>
    <p>My goals for this class is to learn how to properly create websites and portfolios. I've always been super interested in bizzare and unordinary websites, so I'm excited to break the rules as well.</p>
